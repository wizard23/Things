#### eye-tracker.md

##### Abstract:

Eye tracking solution for people who have multiple sklerosis.
Has to be a watertight device.

preferably open source hardware and software,
gnu has some projects


##### Problems:
Eye tracking is not very accurate.
this means that clicking on average sized links on homepages will be a problem,
android and ios buttons are too small, minimum seems to be around 100px.

to get this set up in a way that works with all the needed programs of a full os is going to be a lot of work,
using something like Vibuntu might help and we can get support from the community for sure!:
Vibuntu http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2008120201435NWRL
Enables 3d accelerated (if powerful gfx card) or 2d magnification of the screen.

Gnu has some projects ... to be continued
