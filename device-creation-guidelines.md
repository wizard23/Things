### thing creation guidelines:

##### Be an enhancement
Things allow enhancements and connections that where not possible before.
Build small, cheap and easily replaceable things that can be used in addition to more expensive things by third party companies.

##### Be Simple
Every Thing should be as small as possible, with as few pieces as possible.
We have a baseprice of about 5$ (in production) per Thing,
plus the custom hardware the thing needs.
By keeping our things as simple as possible we can make sure that replacement of failed things will never be a big deal.

##### Be nice to others
No Thing should ever be evil. You should not willingly break other things with your thing.

##### Do not Disturb!
Things should only ask for attention on unrecoverable errors.

##### Do not Spy!
Connections to things outside of the home network are optional and opt-in.

##### Do not build a Prison
Do not force the user into your Prison. Use Open Source Hardware and Software and provide Apis and Documentation.
